Reflection:
===========

    I intially thought it would be a lot simpler to make the go version of this assignment but I
    feel like the kotlin version was a more straightforward. Or at least, it required me (as the 
    programmer) to do less. [will talk more about this in my essay : ) ]

    I'm also kind of sad that I can't figure out why my code isn't matching with your examples. 
    (will write out my process in bugs/limitations)

    Haiku (attempt) 

    Title: Programming Languages

    Languages at end
    Hopefully will not fail class 
    Learned and had some fun 


    Haiku (attempt2)

    Title: IDE for Kotlin

    IntelliJ good
    VSCode hates me so much 
    Why is it like this


    Haiku (attempt3)

    Title: Recursion

    Recursion is weird
    Confounding my mind and soul 
    But I like it now

    (I may be having a bit too much fun with these haikus)

I Worked With:
==============
Talked to Audrey about getting different results & I gave suggestion for sorting method
(i don't think suggestion was used though)

Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
When I use the files for two years (2000-2001) in order to check if it's the same 
as your examples, I found that some things are not matching up. 

However, when I checked my answer with the files themselves I believe my output should
be correct. 

For the year 2000:
* Opened CSV file in Excel
* Sorted data by name in the Girls column
* The name 'Marlen' is found in row number 729
* The sum of the frequencies is 1436512
* Marlen's frequency is 212
* Percentage total girl's names is 100 * (212/1436512) = 0.0148

Output from my program:
Girl Marlen     1  212 0.0148
alphabetic position 729

Output from the course webpage:
Girl  Marlen           1     212   0.0074
     alphabetic position 760
