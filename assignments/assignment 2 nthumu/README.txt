Reflection:
===========

     Closures were a difficult concept for me to grasp since I didn't quite
     understand how the input worked/how to get the inner function to run. It
     is an interesting language feature however.

N/A

Other comments:
===============
    I put the written answers for each part in the respective go files as 
    commented lines. I hope that's ok! 

    Closures has two versions of the test function. One that runs infinitely 
    and one that works with a given input (given input helps in making sure
    actual code working.)
