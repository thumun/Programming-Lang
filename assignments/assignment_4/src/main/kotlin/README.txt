Reflection:
===========

    This was a really interesting lab. I initially thought I had to do a lot of coding
    but it seemed more thought based (since I ended up using a bunch of library functions instead of
    writing much. This lab really helped in solidifying my understanding of how map and filter works.
    It was pretty difficult to get the print to format right though (not sure how much of a priority that was).
    I am really happy I switched to IntelliJ. It's very nice to get recommendations to make some lines more
    efficient.

Known Bugs or Limitations:
==========================
    Output is different from the one in the assignment description for a few of them.
    However, I found that my answer matches up with the correct alphabetical position
    from the data file (opened it in Excel and sorted alphabetically to check).
    **This is the case for Marlen (also the percentage is different)
